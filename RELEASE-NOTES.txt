* Release 1.4
- Added logging config to settings for full python logging
  + /var/log/mars/mars.log
  + /var/log/mars/mars-detail.log
    - Among other things, this logs all the SQL used to talk to the DB.
- mars: admin/audit/auditrecord is much more consistent. All columns
  are filled in and accurate. (If not, submit bug report.) In
  particular, the "fstop" column indicates the current resting place
  of the fits file. You want it to be "archive" for a complete ingest
  success.
