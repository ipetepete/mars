* Questions/thoughts for user admin
  * Users won't have a django db instance, they will be managed by ldap...?
  * The admin will actually not be part of the django admin, but some password protected pages
    for administering users
  * User-facing admin pages will also need to be built for managing profiles/passwords?

* Need to get ldap login/host info
** Found: Relavent info is here: https://bytebucket.org/noao/opswiki/wiki/ldap/ldap_sync.sh?token=9d43306e3cea877d3eaa9fbf07ff07819ea482b0&rev=71aaa9e1818252d34a6f0b80820dd6cdb8596c7c
